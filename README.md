# java-Mazeworld

Mazeworld is a world that is enclosed in a finite width and length. Living in this world is a robot (or multiple robots). Said robot can move in any of four directions: north, east, south, west. At multiple coordinates, there are barriers that the robot cannot collide into. The goal is to get the robot from the start point to the end point. After solving a simple maze variation, we moved on to multiple robot mazes and blind robot mazes. The algorithms used to solve the maze are A* Search and BFS.
